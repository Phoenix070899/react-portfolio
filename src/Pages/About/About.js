        Dear Human Resources, I am writing to introduce myself to you, hoping
        that you will agree to work with me this year to develop my career
        goals. I am interested in working in the Development field to explore
        career opportunities and learn about career fields. Have strong
        fundamental skills in HTML, CSS, JS, and I want to apply them in a
        professional environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        As my passion for this field, I will improve my knowledge not only in
        jobs but also in every challenge to extend my limitation. I am a fresher
        Front - End Developer, and thinking of pursuing a career in it. I know
        that I like creating functional, user-friendly websites and I have made
        some projects while I am learning. My studies have given me an
        understanding of how to use advanced tools to understand the process of
        creating websites efficiently.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the previous position, I worked as a Graphic Design on E-commerce
        platforms such as Shopee, Lazada, and Tiki at Lixibox Cosmetic. I
        believe I have gained insight into the importance of building a
        memorable consumer experience that aligns with a brand. I have also had
        to learn how to collaborate as part of a team, communicate clearly, and
        make decisions when necessary. I believe I could contribute to your team
        and look forward to hearing from you.
      </p>
      <p>Sincerely, Trung DÅ©ng</p>
