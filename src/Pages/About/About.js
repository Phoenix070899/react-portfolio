        I am writing to introduce myself to you, hoping that you will give me an
        opportunities to work with your company to develop my career goals. I am
        interested in working in the Development field to explore career
        opportunities and learn about career fields. Have strong fundamental
        skills in HTML, CSS, JS, ReactJS and I want to apply them in a
        professional environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        As my passion for this field, I will improve my knowledge not only in
        jobs but also in every challenge to extend my limitation. I am a Front -
        End Developer, and thinking of pursuing a career in it. I know that I
        want to create functional, user-friendly websites and I have made some
        projects while I was learning. My studies have given me an understanding
        of how to use advanced tools and understand the process of creating
        websites efficiently.

        As a Front-end Web Developer in my previous position at Minerva
        Technology Solution, I worked on some projects in the banking system. I
        believe I gained so much experience and knowledge when getting access to
        real projects' source code, adding new features, and coding effectively.
        I also know how to collaborate with others as part of a team,
        communicate clearly, and make decisions when necessary.
